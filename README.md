# SCAMP-Assesment
She Code Africa Kaggle Titanic

# Project Name
This project is originally uploaded here as an assessment for the She Code Africa mentorship program, Data Science track.
This notebook is my first and only existing submission so far, and placed me at 93% on the Leader Board.

#### -- Project Status: [On-Hold]
New notebook testing different Feature Engineering and encoding methods, as well as new combinations with AdaBoost and other ensembles are still held on Kaggle.
Thinking of delving into more advanced Hackathons now.

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict which passengers would survive the titanic crash.

### Methods Used
* Data Exploration and Visualization
* Feature Enginering
* Category Encoders
* Machine Learning

### Technologies
* Python
* Scikit Learn and Category Encoders
* Kaggle Kernel

## Project Description
The data set was provided by Kaggle on the website.
In approaching this problem, I did a lot of research on the real Titanic, it's passengers, and the survivors. 
It was quite an emotional journey as I was opportune to read many recounts of the experiences onboard the titanic. 
Indeed, it was a magnificent ship.
My analysis helped me to come to quite a number of hypothesis which helped in my featuree engineering. 
My research helped me discover that there was a policy onboard to evacuate first, the women and children. 

Two major hypothesis I explored were: 
- children, much more than adults survived
- women, much more than men survived
- first class passengers, more than any other, had a better likelihood of survival
- crew members had very little chance of survival as they gave way for passengers during evacuation. 
I made an assumption that all who did not pay a fare were crew mwmbers.
- no band member survived as history has it that the band played till the Titanic was submerged. 
However, there was no specific way to identify band members from the data because their companies did buy tickets for them. 
There was more than 1 band group aboard the Titanic 

I mostly made use of Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for exploration visualisation, since the end goal was a model, and not a data story. 
I made use of simple techniques like mean and median to input missing values.
However, I totally omitted the 'Cabin' feature as not only that more than 70% of the data there was missing, 
my research helped me come to the conclusion that everyone had a cabin at least.

## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- feature engineering
- machine learning model hyper parmeter tuning
- writeup/reporting
